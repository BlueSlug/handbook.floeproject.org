## What is Sonification?

Sonification is a general term for conveying information or data through non-speech audio - compare to the much better-known term "visualization". Many of us are familiar with simple sonification as an aspect of the user interface of computers or other digital devices, such as alert sounds when receiving new email.

*Data sonification* is an analogous audio technique to *data visualization* where structured data is converted into another form in order to communicate aspects of often-complex information clearly and efficiently, to support specific analysis of aspects of the data, or to show patterns and relationships in the data.

## The Case for Sonification in Open Educational Resources

While visualization is commonly used in many areas of education, sonification is a more theoretical and experimental area. This makes it both challenging and exciting as a potential means of supporting ["the creation of variations and enhancements"](/Techniques.html#AllowTheCreationOfVariationsAndEnhancements) in OER.

Sonification's most obvious audience would seem to be the learner with visual impairments, but it may also be appreciated by those with cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, or a preference for audio presentation.

### Floe Work

The Floe team is experimenting with sonification and building tools to support it as part of authoring tools as part of its work in exploring multimodal content creation and presentation in OERs.

The <a href="http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/" target="blank" class="link-external">Floe chart authoring tool</a> is an example of building a multimodal authoring tool that produces three forms of content from inputted data:

* A pie chart
* A data table that also functions as the chart's legend
* A sonified form of the data

## Sonification, Visualization and Underlying Data

Layering sonification into the more familiar paradigm of data visualization explicitly surfaces that charts and graphs are a derived representation of a data set, and that one way OERs can support diverse learners and meet the [Accessibility Principles](/AccessiblityPrinciples.html) of perceivability and understandability is to make underlying data sets available wherever possible when presenting information in charts, graphs or other derived forms.

When underlying data is available in OERs, this allows the possibility for others to transform the OER in ways the content creator may not have envisioned in order to best serve individual learner needs.
