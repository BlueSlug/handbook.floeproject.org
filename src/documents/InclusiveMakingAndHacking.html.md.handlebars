Hackathons, makeathons and similar events have become very popular in recent years, both in traditional learning contexts such as schools, colleges and universities, and in broader world.

Ideas of "hacking" and "making" have also been popularized as approaches to creatively and collaboratively solve problems in society, business and government.

Where does inclusive design fit into such approaches?

## Notes on Terminology

### Hackathon

We use the term "hackathon" expansively in this entry to refer to events that emphasize intensive short-term collaboration between small groups, usually (but not always) physically co-located. The groups typically ideate, design and prototype around themes such as <a href="http://arthackathon.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="link-external">art</a> or <a href="http://civictech.ca/2016/04/08/codeacross-toronto-community-collaboration-in-celebration-of-international-open-data-day/" target="_blank" class="link-external">open data</a>, then present their result in some form to to the larger gathering throughout the event or at the end.



While these events are often focused on producing or proposing new software or hardware as a means of addressing a social problem or creating a new product, this is not stricly necessary; hackathons have been held to produce
<a href="https://www.policyhack.com.au/" target="_blank" class="link-external">government policy</a>, or ideas to address <a href="http://foodinnovationprogram.org/hacking-hunger/" target="_blank" class="link-external">food security</a>.

### Hacking

We use the term "hacking" expansively here to refer to ideas of in-depth learning by doing, do-it-yourself and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture" target="_blank" class="link-external">"playful cleverness"</a> that we can also find present in the term "making". We feel (though others might disagree) that the concepts have enough overlap to discuss them together.

## Why Inclusive Hackathons and Hacking?

It's sometimes said about hackathons that the connections and ideas that get made are more important than any products that get produced. If hackathons are about building community, issues of inclusion, exclusion and audience diversity are paramount to their design.

## Why Inclusive Making and Hacking?

- Making, hacking and hands-on learning for education - what is it and how we bring inclusive design practices to bear on it?

- we'll use "hackathon" throughout as a shorthand for a number of different activities and events like
    - hackathons
    - makeathons
    - ???

- makeathons and hackathons have become popular in educational circles - why?
    - connections that get made are as important as the products that get made
- who gets excluded from these and how do we redesign them?
    - the intersection of the social construction of disabilities and hacking/making
    - pie slice exercise
    - gender and race in STEM

- can we use the makeathon / hackathon angle in non-STEM disciplines? Across disciplines?
    - this concept already exists, we just call it other things than this...

- what do we talk about when we talk about inclusion?
    - gender
    - culture
    - class
    - disability
    - race

## Scenarios (Classroom &amp; Otherwise)

- Making sure students with disabilities are included
- Working with the community of people with disabilities
- Ed tech hackathons
- Code sprints
- Extracurricular events for students
