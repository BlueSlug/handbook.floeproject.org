## Why Inclusive Making and Hacking?

- Making, hacking and hands-on learning for education - what is it and how we bring inclusive design practices to bear on it?

- we'll use "hackathon" throughout as a shorthand for a number of different activities and events like
    - hackathons
    - makeathons
    - ???

- makeathons and hackathons have become popular in educationl circles - why?
    - connections that get made are as important as the products that get made
- who gets excluded from these and how do we redesign them?
    - the intersection of the social construction of disabilities and hacking/making
    - pie slice exercise
    - gender and race in STEM

- can we use the makeathon / hackathon angle in non-STEM disciplines? Across disciplines?
    - this concept already exists, we just call it other things than this...

- what do we talk about when we talk about inclusion?
    - gender
    - culture
    - class
    - disability
    - race

## Scenarios (Classroom & Otherwise)

- Making sure students with disabilities are included
- Working with the community of people with disabilities
- Ed tech hackathons
