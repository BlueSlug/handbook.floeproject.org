Hackathons, makeathons and similar events have become very popular in recent years, both in traditional learning contexts such as schools, colleges and universities, and in broader world.

Ideas of "hacking" and "making" have also been popularized as approaches to creatively and collaboratively solve problems in society, business and government.

Where does inclusive design fit into such approaches?

## Notes on Terminology

### Hackathon

We use the term "hackathon" expansively in this entry to refer to events that emphasize intensive short-term collaboration between small groups, usually (but not always) physically co-located. The groups typically ideate, design and prototype around themes such as <a href="http://arthackathon.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="link-external">art</a> or <a href="http://civictech.ca/2016/04/08/codeacross-toronto-community-collaboration-in-celebration-of-international-open-data-day/" target="_blank" class="link-external">open data</a>, then present their result in some form to to the larger gathering throughout the event or at the end.

While these events are often focused on producing or proposing new software or hardware as a means of addressing a social problem or creating a new product, this is not stricly necessary; hackathons have been held to produce
<a href="https://www.policyhack.com.au/" target="_blank" class="link-external">government policy</a>, or ideas to address <a href="http://foodinnovationprogram.org/hacking-hunger/" target="_blank" class="link-external">food security</a>.

### Hacking

We use the term "hacking" expansively here to refer to ideas of in-depth learning by doing, do-it-yourself and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture" target="_blank" class="link-external">"playful cleverness"</a> that we can also find present in the term "making". We feel (though others might disagree) that the concepts have enough overlap to discuss them together.

## Why Inclusive Hackathons and Hacking?

It's sometimes said about hackathons that the connections and ideas that get made are more important than any products that get produced. If hackathons are about building community, issues of inclusion, exclusion and audience diversity are paramount to their design.

In thinking about inclusive design for hackathons, we must ask ourselves some of the same questions we ask in other contexts:

* <a href="WhatIsTheApproach.md#whoIsExcluded">Who might be excluded?</a> and how do we redesign our approach to guard against this? This is especially critical for hackathons trying to tackle social challenges faced by identifiable groups such as people with disabilities, under the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_About_Us_Without_Us" target="_blank" class="link-external">*Nothing About Us Without Us*</a>.

* Because we define Inclusive Design as design that considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference, our vision for inclusive hackathons and hacking must encompass more than the (vital!) practice of accomodation for people with disabilities through the design of the physical space, the preparation of alternate formats for information, and services such as sign language interpretation.

### STEM Diversity

Because hacking and making are strongly associated with STEM disciplines, it's not possible to discuss this subject without reference to the widespread work that has gone on to interrogate and address the issue of demographic diversity in STEM both academically and in the wider world.

## Why Inclusive Making and Hacking?

- Making, hacking and hands-on learning for education - what is it and how we bring inclusive design practices to bear on it?

- we'll use "hackathon" throughout as a shorthand for a number of different activities and events like
    - hackathons
    - makeathons
    - ???

- makeathons and hackathons have become popular in educational circles - why?
    - connections that get made are as important as the products that get made
- who gets excluded from these and how do we redesign them?
    - the intersection of the social construction of disabilities and hacking/making
    - pie slice exercise
    - gender and race in STEM

- can we use the makeathon / hackathon angle in non-STEM disciplines? Across disciplines?
    - this concept already exists, we just call it other things than this...

- what do we talk about when we talk about inclusion?
    - gender
    - culture
    - class
    - disability
    - race
