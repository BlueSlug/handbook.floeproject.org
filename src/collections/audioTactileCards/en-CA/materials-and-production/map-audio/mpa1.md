    description: Integrate the 3D printed tactile surface with electronic devices to create audio interaction points.
---
- Devices must be made available to students if they do not have access.
- **Tip:** give guidelines on its use.
- **Tip:** conductive materials can be used to create interaction points, such as 3D printing conductive filament or
conductive ink.
- **Tip:** low-cost electronics, tablets, smartphones and computer vision are alternatives for adding audio to the
tactile surface.
- **Examples:** Near Field Communication (NFC) tags, capacitive sensors, Arduino electronic boards, Raspberry Pi,
proximity sensors, applications, touch screen, cameras, QR Code recognition.
