    description: Consider that the audio description has the role of informing and mediating the student's exploration, not of interpreting the object for him. However, there is no neutral language, nor translation without intermediation.
---
- The audio should allow the student to find their own emotions, sensations and interpretations.
- Be aware that your subjectivity is present in the material, but that the right to interpret the content belongs to
the students.
