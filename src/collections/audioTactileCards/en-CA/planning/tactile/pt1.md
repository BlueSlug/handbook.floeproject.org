    description: Consider that there is no single correct exploration of the audio-tactile graphic, as it depends on the context of application and pedagogical objectives. However, some postures and hand movements are frequently used in tactile exploration.
---
- Postures: (1) Grasping: holding the graphic with one hand and exploring with the other; (2) Stabilize: use one hand
to fix the graphic on the table and use the other to explore; (3) Diverging: exploration with two hands in different
elements; (4) Converge: exploration with your hands in a single element.
- Movements: (1) Feel: feel the graphic's textures and shape; (2) Measure: use of hands to approximately measure the
tactile element's size; (3) Compare: compare two tactile elements to check if they represent the same concept; (4)
Count: count of the same tactile elements in the graphic; (5) Communicate: indicate, explain or inquire about the
graphic. The movement can be to feel the image as a whole or elements individually.
