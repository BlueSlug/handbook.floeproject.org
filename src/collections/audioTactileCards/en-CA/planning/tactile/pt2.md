    description: Explore different tactile elements to accommodate the blind student's needs, but prioritize familiar symbols.
---
- Consider that the entire tactile surface must be accessible to be explored and reached by the fingers (except for
object representations with holes).
- **Tip:** if you need to differentiate equal elements, use different sizes.
- **Examples:** points, symbols, geometric shapes, lines, dashed lines, arrows, areas, textures, geographic north,
spatial references.
