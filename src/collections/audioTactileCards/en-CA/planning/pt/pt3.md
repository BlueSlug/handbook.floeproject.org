    description: Simplify the tactile surface by removing small details or decorations. Consider that tactile information should be simple, clear and salient, without redundant information or exaggerated details.

- Simplification should not mischaracterize the represented object, so keep characteristics that refer to the real object.
- **Tip:** if you want to show these details, make another graphic on a larger scale.
