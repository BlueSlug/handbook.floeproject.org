<div class="audio-tactile__intro">

Here we present 45 recommendations for the design of 3D printed audio-tactile graphics, organized into three categories:

- Planning,
- Materials and Production, and
- Context, Use, and Inclusion.

The recommendations are arranged on interactive cards (see diagram) containing:

- The recommendation code (code legend),
- The recommendation,
- Additional information, tips and/or examples.

You can use these recommendations freely and at any order it suits you best.

Although audio-tactile graphics can be applied to many settings, these recommendations are aimed at inclusive education.
Refer back to the main article for more information.

These recommendations are the result of the doctoral thesis by Emilia Christie Picelli Sanches, from the
[Design Graduate Program (PPGDesign)](http://www.prppg.ufpr.br/site/ppgdesign/pb/), at the
[Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR)](https://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/) and with the collaboration of the Inclusive Design
Research Center (IDRC) at OCAD University.

The research was funded by the [Brazilian Federal Foundation for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES)](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br).
